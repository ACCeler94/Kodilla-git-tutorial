            <h1 class="title">Fear No More</h1>
            <h2 class="author">By William Shakespeare</h2>
            <p>
                Fear no more the heat o' the sun;
                Nor the furious winter's rages,
                Thou thy worldly task hast done,
                Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages;
                Golden lads and girls all must,
                As chimney sweepers come to dust. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Fear no more the frown of the great,
                Thou art past the tyrant's stroke:
                Care no more to clothe and eat;
                To thee the reed is as the oak:
                The sceptre, learning, physic, must
                All follow this, and come to dust. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Fear no more the lightning-flash,
                Nor the all-dread thunder-stone;
                Fear not slander, censure rash;
                Thou hast finished joy and moan;
                All lovers young, all lovers must
                Consign to thee, and come to dust. 
            </p>
            <p>
                No exorciser harm thee!
                Nor no witchcraft charm thee!
                Ghost unlaid forbear thee!
                Nothing ill come near thee!
                Quiet consummation have;
                And renowned be thy grave!
            </p>
